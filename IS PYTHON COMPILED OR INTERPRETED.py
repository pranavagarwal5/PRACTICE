# BOTH ARE APPLICABLE TO PYTHON

# INTERPRETER =  SO FIRST COMPILE(FOR NORMAL TO BYTE)
#                   INTERPRETOR( FOR BYTE TO MACHINE LANGUAGE)
# VIRTUAL MACHINE - python virtual machine
# on PVM , we can run python code
PVM interpret the byte to machine code

What about python shell, it also creates byte code and then pvm converts it to machine code

# cypthon
python is just a language
whatever we have learnt till now is cypthon

and there are many ther implementation as well:
1. CPYTHON ( INTERNAL WORKING IS IN C LANGUAGE)
2. PyPy
3. IRONPYTHON   ( IN .net)
4. JYTHON    ( IMPLEMENTATION IN DONE N JAVA)
 in industry, mostly
if Cpython is used:
